# MINDNews_Recommendation

The primary objective of this project is to construct a news recommender system. The project focuses on developing a Neural Attentive Mixture Model (NAML) designed to predict the user click-through rate (CTR) on news articles. The inspiration for this project stems from the work titled "Neural News Recommendation with Attentive Multi-View Learning"
